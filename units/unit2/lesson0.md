# Lesson 0:  Log defects in JIRA

We will get practice with using JIRA and writing detailed bug reports.

## Setup

1. [Create](https://www.atlassian.com/try/cloud/signup?bundle=jira-software) a JIRA account if you haven't already.
2. Create a sample project.

## Exercise

1. Read this: https://medium.com/all-things-picardy/writing-the-perfect-bug-report-with-jira-26b8e4284a9f
2. [This](http://adam.goucher.ca/parkcalc/) is a parking calculator. It has bugs in it. Play around with it and record bugs into JIRA. Note: you may not see "Bug" under the issue type - just pick "Task" instead.
