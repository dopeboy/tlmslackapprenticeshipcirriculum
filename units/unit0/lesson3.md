## Instructions

Suppose you are in charge of testing the Slack web client. Copy [this](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wyR53mALq0qHzddFK7b2CA9S4ywsNcKRJVtl_niO42o/edit?usp=sharing) spreadsheet and write ten new test cases. One sample test case has been provided. Only focus on the columns with green headers.

If you need to, create an empty Slack workspace so that you derive the requirements. Remember to be precise with your language and as detailed as possible.
