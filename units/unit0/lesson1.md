# Lesson 1: The value of QA

In this lesson, we will go over the purpose QA serves and why it is important in software. Throughout this lesson, references will be made to a fictional chair company called Chairs Inc.

## Do now

If a product has defects in it, what effects could this discovery have on the company outside of reduced sales for the defected product? Take a couple minutes to write down a couple unintended consequences of bad QA.

## Functional

The immediate and most obvious value of QA is producing a functional product. If a product doesn't work or works but not all the time, customers won't buy it and the business will fold.

## Cost

Performing QA saves money before the product is shipped and afterwards too.

Suppose we're in the process of making a new chair at Chairs Inc. During the design process, unbeknownst to the architect, a defect is introduced. Later on, during the construction phase, the assemblers realize the newly built chairs are not sturdy. Because the initial design was not adequately QA'd, now Chairs Inc has to dispose of all these faulty chairs and restart the design and construction process. This mistake cost a lot of money but it could have been worse. Suppose the chairs were sturdy but tested only to a 200 pound load instead of the consumer mandated 300 pound load. Shipping all of these chairs out to retail outlets and having customers buy them only to discover that a lot of them don't work would trigger a massive recall process and cost even more money.

All of these applies to software. The later a bug is found, the most costly it is to fix it.

Here's the takeaway in visual form:

And here is a real world example poor QA: the $5 billion lost in market cap for Equifax:

## Reputation

Lackluster QA can have long term effects too. And unlike lost revenue which tends to be shortterm, these long term effect can permeate into a company's brand. When customers no longer see excellence in a company, they're no longer expect it. They will start to associate that company with poor standards and will no longer shop from it. When you go to perform QA work, know that you are not just upholding the product or the team behind the product. **You are upholding and preserving the brand of the entire company**.

## Regulatory

In some industries such as defense, finance, etc, there are regulatory requirements around QA. These regulations can be specific and often contain language that specifies how software QA should be performed. Watchdog agencies perform checks on such companies for compliance and fee when necessary.

## Summary

There are four reasons why QA plays an important role. Good QA saves the company money, keeps its reputation high, complies with regulatory rules, and most importantly, delivers functional products to happy customers.

## Exit ticket

Suppose you are in the business of building a new vaccine to stop the Flu. Describe the functional, cost, reputation, and regulatory hazards you face if your organizationd does not perform rigorous QA.
