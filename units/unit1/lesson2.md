# Lesson 2:  Write an API test

We will write some tests for the GitHub API using Postman.

## Setup

Download [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/apps) and get familiar with it. Test some GitHub endpoints from [this](https://developer.github.com/v3/guides/getting-started/) guide. Read [this](https://www.getpostman.com/docs/v6/postman/scripts/test_scripts) guide about writing tests with Postman.

## Exercise

Write tests for the following endpoints:

1. `GET /users/:username`
2. `GET /repos/:owner/:repo`
3. `GET /repos/:owner/:repo/comments/:comment_id/reactions`

Make sure to test the responses in multiple ways. Use TinyValidator.
