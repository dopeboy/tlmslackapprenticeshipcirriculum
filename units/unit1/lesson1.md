# Lesson 1:  Writing your own frontend test

We will write a unit test, an integration test, an E2E test, and a visual test. We'll use Enzyme, Selenium, and Applitools.

## Setup

We will build our tests on top of a Todo app. Clone [this](https://github.com/dopeboy/react-simple-boilerplate) repository and follow the instructions in the README.

Take a couple minutes to play around with the app and familiarize yourself with the code. Read the files in the `tests` directory. 

## Exercise

In each *.test.js file, you will find 1-2 sample tests. Write 3-4 more additional tests in each file.

For the visual test, you will need to create an account on [Applitools](https://applitools.com/) and insert your API key on line 22. It is worth reading [1] and [2] to understand how Applitools works before writing your own test.
